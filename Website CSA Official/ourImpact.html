    <p>Adoption Regulation 2017
        The Adoption Regulations 2017 have been framed keeping in mind the issues and challenges faced by CARA and other stake holders including the Adoption Agencies & Prospective Adoptive Parents (PAPs). This will further strengthen adoption program in the country by streamlining the adoption process. Transparency, early de-institutionalization of children informed choice for the parents, ethical practices and strictly defined timelines in the adoption process are the salient aspects of the Adoption Regulations.</p>
