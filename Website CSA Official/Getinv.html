        Millions of underprivileged children today are deprived of basic accessibility to health facilities, education and nutrition. Most of them are subjected to abuse, forced labour or marriage at a very early age.
        
        While our efforts focus on tackling these issues, in this journey of making their lives better, your association and volunteering support can make a huge difference. Together we can impact young lives and work towards providing them with better need of care and protection.<a"https://give.do/nonprofits/catalysts-for-social-action"></a></b></p>
