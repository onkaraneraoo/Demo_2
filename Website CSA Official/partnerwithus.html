    <p>3,70,000 children – a large number of our country’s future – live in childcare institutions. Another 1,20,000 children in India have lost a parent due to the pandemic.

        At Catalysts for Social Action we are on a mission to transform the lives of these vulnerable children for the better. We believe that “Every Child Matters” and with your support, we know we can do it!
        
         Over the last 20 years, we have partnered with various organizations like Aditya Birla Capital, P&G Health, Accelya, Wipro Foundation, SBI Capital Markets and many more to create a sustainable impact on India’s children. We invite you to join us in this endeavour through your organization’s CSR program. 
        
         With our impact-oriented programs which are directly linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we provide you with tailor-made solutions to integrate with your CSR program. Don’t have a CSR program, but you want to ensure happy childhoods for India’s children? Don’t worry, we have you covered! Our highly experienced and dedicated team will guide you and help you select interventions suited to your interest! We are the perfect place to start your philanthropic journey!
        
         So, this brings us to the critical question – how do we invest in India’s future?</p>
